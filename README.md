# Next.js projects with multiple API CALL

The main goal of that project is to practice working with REST API by solving various tasks, where we retrieve data from two different APIs. 
Very important, each Task is treated as a separate new project and I do not focus on styles.
I focus mainly on RESTful-based data fetching. 

Check the link to the [Demo](https://curious-brioche-ee3e50.netlify.app/)

Additionally, I created navigation between tasks to make the project clearer and more readable.
